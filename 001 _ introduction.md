# C++ Vars, Literals & constants

## 1/3 VARIABLES


```c++
int x = 15;
```
1) note :
x is a variable and the int is the data type , and we have assigned an integer value 15 to it.
2) note :
we can use the double , why? cause decimals and exponentials should have double type to store in.


```c++
int x = 1;
x = 2;
```
3) note :
the value of a variable can be changed.


4) note :
a var name can only have alpha , num and the inderscore .


5) note :
a var cannot begin with a number.


6) note :
a var should not but could begin with an uppercase character.


7) note :
a var name cannot be a keyword , like " int " .


8) note :
a var name cannot start with an underscore " _ " .

## 2/3 LITERALS
- integers: an integer is not a fractionnal or exponential part " integer different from double " , there are three types of integer literals in C : decimal ( example : 0 , -9 ) OR octal (example : 021 , 077 ) OR hexaD ( example : 0x7f , 0x 547 ) .
1) note :
in C++ programming octal starts with 0 and hexaD starts with 0x .

- floats: a numeric litteral has a fractional/exponential form ( example : -2.0 , 0.00001 )
2) note :
in C++ programming E-5= 10^-5 .

- chars: a character created by a single quotation marks ( example : 'a' , 'A' , '\' ) .

- espace sequences : using of characters that connot by typed . ( example : \t , \n , \0)
3)note : 
"\0" means null character.

- strings: a sequence of characters enclosed in double quotations makrs , ( example : "hi" , "" , "   " , "lol\n")

## 3/3 VARIABLES
a vaiables whose value cannot be changed , we use the  **const** keyword , 
 example : 
```c++
const int x = 5;
```
