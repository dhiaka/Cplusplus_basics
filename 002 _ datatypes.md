# C++ DATATYPES

## 0/4 one minute
1) note :
datatypes are declarations of variables

" int x = 5; "
2) note :
it means x is a variable of int type , and the x could store integers of either 2 or 4 bytes! .

## 1/4 BASICS of dataTypes
some of datatypes sizes:
1. int : 2 bytes || 4 bytes

2. float : 4 bytes

3. double : 8 bytes

4. char : 1 byte

5. bool : 1 byte

6. void : 0 byte 

## 2/4 DECLARATIONS OF dataTypes
- C++ int:
"int x = 5; " : means its size is usally 4 bytes

- C++ floats and doubles:
" float x = 5.01; "
" double x = 5.01; " or " double x = 5E12; " : means the size of a float is 4 bytes and the size of a double is 8 bytes ; then the double dataType has two times the precision of the float dataType.

- C++ char:
"char c = 'a'; " : means it size 1 byte.
1) note:
characters in C++ are enclosed inside single quotes ' ' .

- C++ bool:
"bool b = true; "
"bool b99 = false;" : means its size usally 1 byte.
2) note:
booleans are used in conditional statements and loops.

- C++ void:
3) note:
void means "nothing" or "no value".

## 3/4 TypeModifiers
we can modify the dataTypes using the typeModifiers,
there are 4 types modifiers:
1. signed

2. unsigned

3. short

4. long

1) note:
we can use those 4 dataModifiers to these dataTypes:
- int

- double

- char

## 4/4 derivedDataTypes
( example : arrays, pointers, function, structures ...)

note: DataTYpes that are derived from the original dataTypes are derived types.
